# Hare Lynx Multiple Shooting with DiffeqFlux

A working example of multiple shooting is demonstrated.  The oscillations of the populations of Hare and Lynx are approximated.
The model results are then visualized and parameters are used to solve the ODE problem and predict future population levels.
